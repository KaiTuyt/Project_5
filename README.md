﻿# Project 5Project Five consists of two separate files that use the ideas of the first three projects, and implements them into a user-friendly GUI. The two files, Driver.java and MesoCalculations.java,  produce a way for the GUI to display to the user a Hamming Station's selected distances, as well as finding stations with a similar distance, adding stations, creating random stations, and printing stations that start with a certain character.### Problem-Solving ApproachFor this project, we were tasked with creating a program that followed the constraints set by the project's outline. I decided to split the program itself into two different classes: Driver.java, the file that displays the GUI itself, and MesoCalculations.java, the file that calculates all of the required information.In Driver.java, the program creates the GUI by creating multiple smaller GridPanes and adding them to one final GridPane. The top left part of the GUI holds a Slider with values from 1-4 which represent a desired Hamming Distance to search for, as well as a TextField that displays the chosen distance. Below that there is a ComboBox that has a list of all stations from the provided text file, "Mesonet.txt". In-between these two, there is a Button that, when pressed, displays the stations in ascending order that have a distance equal to the value selected by the Slider for the station chosen in the ComboBox. In the middle/bottom left section of the GUI, there is a Button and a set of TextFields that show the amount of stations with a specific Hamming Distance (ranging from 0-4) compared to the chosen station when the Button is pressed. In addition, at the very bottom of the left side, there is another Button with a TextField that allows for a custom station to be added to the list; however, the station must follow the constraints of how a normal station is formatted (only 4 characters consisting of letters and numbers). On the right side, for our free zone area, I have added a few simple additions to help assist the program, a few of which have been taken from previous projects. At the top, the selected station's index within the list of stations is displayed when the "Calculate HD" Button is pressed. Beneath that, there is a button that, when pressed, adds a station of random uppercase letters and numbers to the list. After that, I have included some of the functions that we accomplished in Project 2; the chosen station's Ascii Average, Letter Average, and the amount of stations that start with the same letter are displayed, as well as a list of said stations.
